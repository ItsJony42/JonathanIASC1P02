		<p id = "overview"> The beginning of the MCU is when the Infinity Saga first kicked off.
			The Infinity Saga consists of the first major plotline, which is the Infinity Stones.
			All the movies leading up to the climax of the saga each had something that relates
			to the stones, and every movie built up to the two major movies that were about the
			collection of the stones, with Thanos as the main antagonist.

<h2 class="phase"> Phase One </h2>

<h4 class="phases" id="IronMan"> Iron Man </h4>
<div id="IronDesc" class="Phases"> Iron Man is the first movie in the MCU, and it is what began the Infinity Saga. The first
superhero that was introduced was Iron Man, and it set the standard for what to expect in the future movies. Iron Man
 introduced the main character of the MCU; Tony Stark. </div>

 <h4 class="phases" id="Hulk"> The Incredible Hulk </h4>
 <div id="HulkDesc" class="Phases"> The second installment in the MCU introduces the Hulk/Bruce Banner.
 This movie follows Bruce as he deals with the fact he can transform into a green monster, and at the end of the movie
he is seeked out by Tony Stark, who talks with him to join a hero team under an organization - the Avengers. </div>

<h4 class="phases" id="IronMan2"> Iron Man 2 </h4>
<div id="Iron2Desc" class="Phases"> Iron Man 2 is the third movie to release in the MCU,
and it is pretty similar to the first. We get to see Tony develop more as a hero, while also being
introduced to another hero that works similar to him; War Machine. Rhodey is the identity of War
Machine, and the two wear weaponized suits of armor, with both being important to the main timeline.
Black Widow is also introduced in this movie, who is one of the future Avengers. </div>

<h4 class="phases" id="Thor"> Thor </h4>
<div id="ThorDesc" class="Phases"> The first movie in Thor's trilogy is in the first phase, and in this
movie we get introduced into one of the more important characters in the MCU, which is Thor's brother Loki.
Loki and Thor are both super important characters in this saga, with both having connections to the Infinity Stones.
Another important character is introduced here, that being Hawkeye - one of the future avengers. </div>

<h4 class="phases" id="CapAm"> Captain America: The First Avenger </h4>
<div id="CapDesc" class="Phases"> Captain America is the last solo movie in Phase One, and it is the first to introduce an Infinity Stone. This movie is also the first movie
in the chronological timeline, as it takes place during World War II. It introduces a major organization known
as Hydra, which is heavily involved with the Infinity Stones, as the leader of Hydra - Red Skull - is who finds
the first stone, which is The Tesseract. The Tesseract is the cube that holds the Space Stone, one of the more
involved stones in the timeline. </div>

<h4 class="phases" id="Avengers"> Avengers </h4>
<div id="AvengersDesc" class="Phases"> Finally, the last movie of Phase 1 is The Avengers, the first team-up movie.
This movie is the most important, as it explores S.H.I.E.L.D., the main faction of the MCU. The antagonist
of this movie is Loki, as he was found by Thanos - the main villain of the Saga. Thanos gives Loki a sceptor, which
holds the Mind Stone. The plot of the movie revolves around Thanos giving Loki the task to collect the Space Stone,
which S.H.I.E.L.D. has. Along with these plot points, this movie builds the Avengers, which is the main team of the MCU,
with future projects adding onto this team to create a responsive action team for future conflicts on Earth. As of this
movie, the team consists of Iron Man, Captain America, Thor, the Hulk, Black Widow, and Hawkeye. </div>

<h2 class="phase"> Phase Two </h2>

 <h4 class="phases" id="Iron3"> Iron Man 3 </h4>
 <div id="Iron3Desc" class="Phases"> Iron Man 3 is the final movie in the trilogy. It contains an emotional story in
which Tony faces the most character development. This movie caps off the trilogy by introducing the Mandarin, a threatening
character that appears later on in the MCU. The Mandarin in this movie is a fake, who appropriated the persona of the leader
of the Ten Rings - the terrorist organization that started off the plot of the MCU in the first movie. </div>

 <h4 class="phases" id="Thor2"> Thor: The Dark World </h4>
 <div id="Thor2Desc" class="Phases"> The second movie of the Thor trilogy is Thor: The Dark World.
This movie is important as it introduces the third Infinity Stone; the Reality Stone. In this
movie, the stone is known as the Aether, which the main villain finds and uses it for his plans.
After the Avengers, Loki was kept prisoner on Asgard and Thor took the Space Stone back with him
to Asgard. Thor and Loki worked together to stop the villain Malekith from using the Aether, and
in the process, Loki "died". The movie ended with the Asgardians transporting the Reality Stone/The Aether
to The Collector, so that Asgard didn't have 2 stones at once. </div>

<h4 class="phases" id="Cap2"> Captain America: The Winter Soldier </h4>
<div id="Cap2Desc" class="Phases"> This movie is the second of the trilogy, and it returns to the conflict
between S.H.I.E.L.D. and Hydra. After the first movie, Hydra was believed to be disbanded and destroyed.
Throughout the movie, S.H.I.E.L.D. learns that half of their ranks wer infiltrated by Hydra agents. This movie introduces
Sam Wilson/Falcon, another important character who joins the Avengers. Falcon and Captain America work together to take
apart Hydra, and in the process they meet the Winter Soldier - Captain America's old friend. They free from his brainwashing,
and he hides away. Since Hydra inflitrated most of S.H.I.E.L.D., they were able to take the Mind Stone from S.H.I.E.L.D. and
experimented on it.
</div>

<h4 class="phases" id="GOTG"> Guardians of the Galaxy </h4>
<div id="GOTGDesc" class="Phases"> Guardians of the Galaxy is the first movie of its trilogy,
and it introduces a ragtag team of misfits that come together to save the galaxy. This movie
follows the Orb - which is also the Power Stone. Peter Quill first steals it from the planet
Morag, and the villain Ronan hunts after it as instructed by his ally - Thanos. Ronan refuses
Thanos's deal, and he uses the stone for himself to destroy the planet Xandar. The Guardians
consist of Peter Quill/StarLord, Gamora (Thanos's Daughter), Rocket Raccoon, Drax, and Groot
(Rocket's partner). This group defeats Ronan and saves Xandar, which they then give the Power

and collect the Mind Stone/Scepter. They succeed, and use it to create Ultron. Hydra experimented
with the Mind Stone on humans, creating two new important characters; Wanda and Pietro Maximoff.
Later on in the movie, a counter AI is made against Ultron known as Vision, who possess the Mind Stone
in his forehead, and he then joins the Avengers.
The Avengers defeat Ultron, but at the cost of Pietro's life. Wanda and Vision both join the team,
with Falcon and War Machine becoming permannet members as well. The rest of the Avengers regroup,
besides Hulk who entered one of Ultron's flying ships and flew into space. Thor also leaves Earth
