<p>
	<strong> Top Three </strong> <br />
	The <em>Hashira</em> is a rank among the Demon Slayer Corps. <br />
	They are strong swordsman that weild impeccable skills and have <br />
	experience in killing demons.	There nine members of the Hashira, <br />
	and each one has their own unique <em>breathing style</em>. <br />
	<strong>Gyomei Himejima</strong> is a stone breather, and he is the <br />
	strongest of the Hashira. <strong>Sanemi Shinazugawa</strong> is <br />
	a wind breather, and he is definitely the second strongest. Sanemi <br />
	is also my second favourite Hashira. <strong>Giyu Tomioka</strong> <br />
	is the third best and he is also the main Hashira that the story <br />
	focuses on.

<p>
	<em>Jujutsu Kaisen</em> has some of the coolest powers <br />
	in fiction, and my top three favourite ones	are <br />
	<strong>Idle Transfiguration</strong>, <strong>Limitless,</strong>
	and <strong>Cursed Speech.</strong> <br />
	<strong>Idle Transfiguration</strong> is a unique and cool <br />
	technique that allows the owner of the technique <br />
	to physically maniulate the target's soul, which <br />
	shapes their body into whatever they want it to <br />
	be shaped as. <strong>Limitless</strong> is another one of my <br />
	favourite techniques. It is used to repel anything <br />
	around the user, making them untouchable. Finally, <br />
	my absolute favourite cursed technique is <strong>Cursed <br />
	Speech.</strong> It allows the user to use their words and <br />
	compel others to do what they say. This is an <br />
	incredibly cool technique, and it can be used in <br />
	various ways to defeat enemies and win fights. <br />
