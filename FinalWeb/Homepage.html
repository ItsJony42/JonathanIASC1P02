<p id = "overview"> The Marvel Cinematic Universe is an immersive and creative world where many stories have come to life, all connective with each other in many ways. This universe has come a long way since its very first movie back in 2008, and since then there have been several top tier movies and many different interesting plots and characters. The franchise has expanded in many different directions, and in the newest saga the universe has extended into other Marvel franchises like Daredevil, the X-Men, and Spiderman, which previously none were connected to the MCU. The inclusion of dozens of Marvel characters and stories is what makes up the MCU and its greatness, even as it continues to expand.
